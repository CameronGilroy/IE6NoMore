h3. Usage

Place [[!IE6NoMore]] just after the first @<body>@ tag to give a warning to IE6 users without having ugly @<!--[if lt IE 7]><![endif]-->@ tags in your html code!

You can also call the contents of your own chunk like this @[[!IE6NoMore? &Message=`[[$Your_Chunk_Name]]`]]@

You can also use a string of text like @[[!IE6NoMore? &Message=`<h1>Go Away IE6!!</h1>`]]@
